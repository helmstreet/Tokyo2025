# Tokyo Study Abroad

## Welcome!
This course will explore Japanese pop culture across a variety of media: manga, comics, J-Pop, and others. Students will experience the culture first-hand and get a chance to explore these media by creating their own examples. If you'd like to see what last year's trip was like, each of the students made a game about their experience and you can play them below!

Based in Tokyo, students will experience Japanese culture through experiences like attending a Sumo tournament, making their own manga and video games, going to a pig cafe and being snuggled by cute baby pigs, and standing atop the world's highest tower. We'll be visiting various cultural districts of Tokyo, from the high fashion Ginza strip to the electric town of Akihabara. The course will also include a 4 day trip to Hokkaido (via bullet train) where we'll learn about the roots of Ainu culture as well as its present pop-cultural presence.
